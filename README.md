# Ahmet-Ulucay-Drag-and-Carry-Multiplication-Algorithm-AUD&CMA-

Description:
The AUD&CMA is a digit-wise multiplication method for efficiently computing the product of any integer with repeating-digit numbers such as 11, 111, 222, etc. 
It is particularly useful in mental math, educational tools, and constrained computational environments. 
The algorithm decomposes multiplication into a sequence of digit-wise operations, zero padding, sliding window sums, and a specialized carry-forward mechanism.

Use Cases:
* Multiplication by numbers like 11, 111, 222...
* Mental arithmetic techniques
* Educational visualizations for elementary math
* Embedded low-power processors without complex multiplication logic
