ðŸ“„ Ahmet Ulucay Drag-and-Carry Multiplication Algorithm (AUD&CMA)

Abstract:
The Ahmet Ulucay Drag-and-Carry Multiplication Algorithm (AUD&CMA) is a digit-based multiplication technique that decomposes any base-10 multiplication into a series of digit-wise scalar multiplications, symmetrical zero-padding, sliding-window summation, and a specialized carry-forward mechanism. The leftmost digit is preserved in its complete form while all others are reduced to single digits through a cascading carry operation.

1. Technical Field
This algorithm relates to the field of arithmetic computation, digital signal processing, and efficient multiplication techniques suitable for low-complexity processors, educational tools, and novel computing architectures.

2. Background
Traditional long multiplication or Karatsubaâ€™s algorithm involves complex digit placement and recursive logic. 
AUD&CMA simplifies this by using consistent padding and a structured window summation, offering advantages in clarity, implementation, and pedagogical use.

3. Summary of the Invention
The invention introduces:
* A digit-wise multiplication method
* Zero-padding based on a digit-length parameter `k`
* A sliding window of size `k` across a padded digit list
* A drag-and-carry mechanism that enforces single-digit output except at the leftmost position

4. Algorithm Description
Inputs:
* `n`: an integer number to be multiplied
* `b`: a multiplier composed of repeated digits (e.g., `222`)
* `k`: digit-length of `b` (inferred or given)
* `m`: base multiplier such that `b = m Ã— 111...1` (`k` times)

Process:
1. Decompose `n` into digits and multiply each by `m`
2. Pad `(kâˆ’1)` zeros on both left and right
3. Slide a window of size `k` across the padded list
4. Sum each window to get intermediate results
5. Apply drag-and-carry from right to left, preserving the leftmost digit in full form
6. Flatten final values to obtain output number

Output:
A base-10 number representing the product `n Ã— b`.

5. Example
`n = 547`, `b = 222` â†’ `k = 3`, `m = 2`

1. [5, 4, 7] Ã— 2 = [10, 8, 14]
2. Padded: [0, 0, 10, 8, 14, 0, 0]
3. Windows: [10, 18, 32, 22, 14]
4. Carry: [12, 1, 4, 3, 4] â†’ `121434`

...
Important Note:
The leftmost value will be written as is, regardless of how many digits it has. 
All other values must be reduced to *single digits* (unit digit only). 
If a value is a multiple of 10 or greater, the tens digit is carried to the immediate left digit.
